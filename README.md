# dotfiles
> For a comfy and distraction free setup!

My additions to the [ufo xorg build](https://github.com/albithealien/ufo).

1. Run `install.sh` which installs the stuff I use(including go packages)
2. Install all the dotfiles or cherry pick
3. Manually link these to somewhere included in $PATH
* thorium(with the uBlock Origin, Bitwarden, Vimium and YouTube Unhook extensions)
* codium(with the GitHub Themes, Vim, Tinymist Typst and Go extensions)
* bun(runtime)
* pixelorama(editor)
```
# example, yes I literally use a folder named "path/"
ln -s ~/path/codium /usr/bin/code
```
4. Get the AWS, GCP and and Tencent CLIs.

ALL DONE! ðŸŽ‰

# TODO
* Add my YouTube subscriptions
* Maybe try Helix keybindings(meaning practice) or NeoVim(mearning learning Lua) in the future
